                    <p>I was working as a master at the Belarusian NPP construction site for 4 years.
                        Together with other talented engineers,
                        My responsibility was installation of the largest of the existing condensing turbines
                        K-1200-6.8/50 in the world.
                        In the beginning it was difficult, the knowledge that the university gave was not enough,
                        so I had to engage in self-education and catch everything on the spot.
                        Half a year ago I became interested in HTML, CSS and now I am completely sure to become a
                        front-end developer.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Programming is the job of the future. For me it is a whole new world
                        with it's own deep history to comprehend. It's amazing but
                        a few months ago I didn't know anything about JS,
                        but thanks to the Rolling Scopes School I try to solve tasks builded on algorithms
                        now.
                        And learning is just beginning!
                        By the way, it should be easy to get a well paid job as a programmer in feature
                        because so many of them are needed.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>In conclusion, I want to become a programmer because I enjoy designing web applications.
                        I like playing video games and want to learn how to create my own.
                        I have still known a little bit about programming, but want to learn more to make my dreams
                        come true!
